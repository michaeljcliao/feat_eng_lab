# Numerical Feature Classification: A Feature Engineering Case Study

A machine learning project focused on classifying an unlabeled numerical dataset through exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model development.

## Overview

This repository contains a data science workflow applied to a dataset composed exclusively of numerical features and a target classification label. With no contextual metadata, the project emphasizes understanding patterns purely through data exploration and engineering.

## Objectives

- Explore the structure and distribution of numerical features through visualizations and statistical summaries.
- Engineer and select features to improve classification performance.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models using tools such as `scikit-learn` and `XGBoost`.
- Document findings and modeling decisions to provide a clear, reproducible workflow.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11.11
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook
